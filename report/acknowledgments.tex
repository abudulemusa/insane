First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor, Viktor Kuncak, for his
sustained enthousiasm, inspired suggestions and exemplary guidance thourough
the course of this thesis. I would also like to thank him for giving me the
opportunity to work on such interesting subjects, and look forward to working
with him as I continue with my research. I would also like to thank Philippe
Suter for his continuous feedback and guidance without which this thesis would
not have been possible.

I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the members of the Laboratory for
Automated Reasoning and Analysis for numerous stimulating discussions: Ali,
Andrej, Eva, Giuliano, Hossein, Ruzica, Swen and Tihomir: thanks. I would also
like to thank Lukas Rytz for his patience and technical support regarding the
Scala compiler. Finally I thank those who continuously supported me; my
family, my friends, and of course Aline.
