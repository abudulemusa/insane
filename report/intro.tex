\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}
Pointer analysis is a static analysis technique that builds information on the
relations between pointers and allocated objects. It is also often referred to
as points-to or alias analysis.

In most object oriented languages such as Scala, the use of pointers is
overwhelming, rendering even basic static analyses techniques brittle. It is
thus often necessary to establish information on the aliasing relations between
variables, as well as some knowledge of the shape of structures stored in the
heap. This then enables other kinds of analysis or optimization procedures.

Effect analysis tries to summarize the effects of procedures in a certain
domain. In this case, we focus on memory-based effects, and are thus interested
in computing a summary of read and write operations performed to object fields.
It is evident that such effect analysis requires on a good pointer analysis,
and vice-versa. For this reason, we perform both analyses side by side.

\section{Organization of this thesis}
The rest of this thesis is organized as follows: Then,
Chapter~\ref{chap:overview} gives a quick overview of the tool, followed by
in-depth description of the initial analysis phases.
Chapter~\ref{chap:pointer} describes in full details the pointer and effect
analysis phase.  In Chapter~\ref{chap:implementation}, we describe some
technical implementation details. Chapter~\ref{chap:related} describes previous
work done in the field of pointer and effect analysis. We then conclude in
Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} with some ideas for future work.
