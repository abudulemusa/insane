Static program analysis techniques working on object-oriented languages usually
require precise knowledge of the aliasing relation between variables. This
knowledge is, amongs other things, important to understand the actual effects
of method calls on objects. We developed an analysis combining a pointer analysis
coupled with a memory-based effects analysis for the Scala programming
language. This analysis is based on abstract interpretation, and represents the
effects of methods in a graph representation. This representation allows the
analysis to be compositional. We also provide the implementation of this
analysis in \insane, a freely-available extension of the Scala compiler.
