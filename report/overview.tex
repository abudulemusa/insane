\chapter{Tool Overview}
\label{chap:overview}
The tool is made of five distinct phases that are topologically ordered in terms
of dependencies. We briefly describe each of the phases necessary for the
overall analysis. We then describe major phases in their respective section.
The tool is decomposed as follows, in order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Function Extraction}: collects function definitions seen in the abstract syntax tree
    provided by the Scala compiler and extracts pre- and post-conditions.

    \item{Control Flow Graph Generation}: generates a control flow graph for each function
    definition, composed of simple assign statements.

    \item{Class Hierarchy Analysis}: collects information to find all subclasses of a class.

    \item{Type Analysis}: analyzes potential runtime types and builds the initial callgraph.

    \item{Pointer Analysis}: analyzes aliasing effects occurring in each
    function. We describe this phase in full-details in
    Chapter~\ref{chap:pointer}.
\end{enumerate}
