\section{Tool Overview}
The tool is made of five distinct phases that are topologically ordered in terms
of requirements. We briefly describe each of the phases necessary for the
overall analysis. Every major phases will be later described in full details in
their respective section.

The tool is decomposed as follows, in order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Function Extraction}: extracts function definitions seen in the code, as well as
    assertions or requirements.

    \item{CFG Generation}: generates a control flow graph for each function
    definition, composed of simple assign statements.

    \item{Class Hierarchy}: collects information in order to find all subclasses of a class.

    \item{Type Analysis}: analyze potential runtime types and builds initial callgraph.

    \item{Pointer Analysis}: analyze aliasing effects occurring in each function.
\end{enumerate}
