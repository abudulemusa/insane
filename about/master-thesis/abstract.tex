Static program analysis techniques working on object-oriented languages require
precise knowledge of the aliasing relation between variables. This knowledge is
important to, among other things, understand the read and write effects of
method calls on objects. Understanding such effects in turn enables compiler
optimizations and other code transformations such as automated parallelization.
This thesis presents a combination of a pointer analysis with a memory effect
analysis for the Scala programming language. Our analysis is based on abstract
interpretation, and computes summaries of method effects as graphs. This
representation allows the analysis to be compositional. Our second contribution
is an implementation of our analysis in a tool called \insane. Our tool is
built as a plugin for the official Scala compiler. It accepts any Scala
program, and is freely available.
